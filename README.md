Codsoft Internship Projects

During a four-week data science internship at Codsoft from October 15 to November 15, 2023, I engaged in several impactful projects. The Titanic Survival Prediction Project was my first, where I developed a model to predict passenger survival using data like age, gender, and ticket class, delving into maritime history and socio-economic aspects.

Next, I tackled the Movie Rating Prediction Model, predicting film ratings based on genre, director, and actors, which enhanced my understanding of the entertainment industry's dynamics and storytelling impact.

In the Car Purchase Amount Prediction project, I employed linear regression to forecast car purchase amounts based on customer data such as age, salary, and net worth. This project deepened my insights into consumer behavior and market segmentation, revealing the narratives behind the numbers.

The final project was the Credit Card Fraud Detection Model, where I created a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions, a challenging exercise in balancing accuracy and speed in fraud detection.

Throughout the internship, I significantly improved my skills in data preprocessing, model development, evaluation, and strategic problem-solving. Most importantly, I learned to apply theoretical data science knowledge to real-world scenarios across various domains.
